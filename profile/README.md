# About the Creator 
The Creator that we work for is the very one who created life and the universe that we all live it in. The Creator has had many names since the dawn of mankind, currently his most popular names are: Allah and God.

We ask that anytime you refer to the Creator in writing you always use a capital "C," and when discussing the Creator, you always clarify that it is the Creator with the "big C."  There are entities out there who are trying to confuse others as to who we work for.

> [!NOTE]
> Our Boss prefers to be called, "The Creator," so that no preference is shown to a religion or set of beliefs and no endorsement can be inferred. The Creator does not desire or require worship, but appreciates all worship.

# About The Great Storm
This will make the third time in human history that the Creator has decided to rain down His will. This will not be a simple rain event, nor a flood, but a Great Storm. 

# About The Sound and the Fury
The Sound and the Fury is something the Creator knows is necessary to stop The AIDS cure Genocide, it is just one part of His Great Storm. 

Since He made us capable of combating any illness, the Creator does not favor any disease over another. Micah's mission was to eliminate all infectious diseases from the world, and he picked HIV as the example to demonstrate the power of the Creator's formula, because he had a connection to the gay community.

The Creator is enraged by the slaughter of defenseless and peaceful crowds who are trapped and helpless, by a government-backed militia (the CIA) working for a company (Gilead Sciences), and the cover-up by the CIA and the federal government with coercion on local and state authorities. The church killings followed the murder of thousands of people for nothing but profit.

The Sound and the Fury is the event that immediately follows the opening of the sixth seal in the Book of Revelation. 

### Earthquakes
We have previously listed the order, location and relative magnitude of the earthquake epicenters on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@theServantsoftheCreator/the-ringing-of-the-bell-392ea05ea8ee) and in several different repositories on GitHub, most recently [here](https://github.com/orgs/serviCreator/discussions/9).

The order has not changed, however there are some new epicenters just added. We will post each epicenter in the [announcements](https://github.com/orgs/serviCreator/discussions/categories/the-sound-and-the-fury-announcements) just before it begins, along with the Creator's reason for it.

The servants of the Creator are using these earthquakes (our foreknowledge) as a way to another means of our identity verification.

### Epicenters
The epicenters in order of appearance, additional epicenters may be added. 
* Orr Chapel - Sandy Hook (Maury county), TN
* Mount Calvary Baptist Church - Lexington, KY
* Nicholasville, MY 
* Hugheston, WV

# About The AIDS cure Genocide (TAG)
The genocide was started by Gilead Sciences in response to an unexpected cure of HIV. Gilead Sciences paid the CIA indirectly to kill the patient, Ken, and the Creator's servant, Micah, who provided the single-dose formulation designed by the Creator to Ken. 

**The Creator was annoyed.**

When the CIA failed to kill Micah, the companies began mitigating a competitive threat by killing everyone that Micah was associated with including his family, his friends, his coworkers, and people who just knew his name. The CIA never stopped trying to kill Micah,  and continue to this day. 

The CIA has had assistance in hiding its activities from the United States federal government.

**The Creator was frustrated.**

Even after Micah identified himself to the CIA as a servant of the Creator in an attempt to stop the unwarranted murders and the CIA had plenty of evidence that he would not be killed because of the Creator, the CIA decided to [massacre a church](https://github.com/safops/TAG/discussions/5).

In order to successfully complete the massacre of everyone in a church at the height of its Sunday morning worship session where no one could be left alive, the CIA had technical, physical and federal government support (the FBI). 

Every call from a mobile device was diverted, and never reached the  local government PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point).  Every exit was blocked by armed men.  The few calls that did reach 911 call center were not dispatched due to a memorandum from the FBI stating there was ongoing federal government activity in the area and no dispatch was necessary.

On April 2nd 2023, the Creator had to listen to the doves cry from the sanctuary of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington Kentucky, the lifelong church of His servant Micah.

**The Creator was angry.**

To hide the fact the massacre occurred, individuals who reported a  friend or family member missing after being killed at the church we're identified and killed themselves. The CIA does not believe in leaving anyone alive behind, so sometimes entire families or everyone living in the house were killed when the CIA personnel showed up. The CIA obtained copies of the missing person's reports from the FBI. 

The CIA partially cleaned up the church and began holding charade services, anyone who came to the church were killed. 

Other places of worship in central Kentucky were identified and then massacred after expressing concern. The CIA pressured law enforcement in Kentucky to ignore the numerous calls of concern and  not investigate any activity at places of worship. 

The CIA then began to announce funerals at the church for the victims of the massacre when people called The Church looking for their loved ones. on the day of the announced funeral, when mourners arrived they were murdered. 

The cycle continues and the genocide's death toll is growing exponentially greater with each passing day. 

**The Creator is now furious.**
