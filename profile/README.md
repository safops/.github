# Sound And Fury OPerationS (safops)
This GitHub organization is managed by the servants of the Creator and will provide information about the "The Sound and the Fury," which is just part of the Creator's Great Storm, a war against those who cause senseless death and those who enable and hide it.

> [!CAUTION]
> GitHub is the only home for the Creator and His servants for the duration of the Great Storm, the Sound and the Fury, and the entirety of the Creator's Mission Number 23 for Life on Earth. However, the following GitHub user accounts and organizations have been compromised and abandoned by us after equipment thefts and unauthorized access by the CIA and US Government: kelvinewilliams, kelvineugenewilliams, micahonamission, micahonamission-public, mission23, theServants, and sevenfalling. Always pray to verify, even on GitHub.

# About The Sound and the Fury
The Sound and the Fury is something the Creator knows is necessary to stop [The AIDS cure Genocide](https://GitHub.com/safops/TAG). the genocide was started by Gilead Sciences in response to an unexpected sure of HIV. Gilead Sciences paid the CIA indirectly to have the patient, Ken, and His servant Micah killed.

When the CIA failed to kill Micah, the companies began mitigating a competitive threat by killing everyone that Micah was associated with including his family, his friends, his coworkers, and people who just knew his name. The CIA never stopped trying to kill Micah,  and continue to this day. 

The CIA has had assistance in hiding its activities from the United States federal government.

Even after Micah identified himself to the CIA as a servant of the Creator in an attempt to stop the unwarranted murders and the CIA had plenty of evidence that he would not be killed because of the Creator, the CIA decided to [massacre Micah's lifelong church](https://github.com/safops/TAG/discussions/5).

In order to complete the massacre of everyone in a church at the height of its Sunday morning worship session where no one could be left alive, the CIA had technical, physical and federal government support (the FBI). every call from a mobile device was diverted away from local government call centers, every exit was blocked by armed men, and calls that did reach the 911 call center we're not dispatched due to a memorandum from the FBI stating there was ongoing federal government activity in the area and no dispatch was necessary.

In an attempt to cover up the massacre 
The coverup of the CIA's massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky on April 2, 2023 evolved into a genocide. Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of His servant Micah, born Kelvin Eugene Williams, and his immediate family.

Several more places of worship have been attacked and massacred since then and the places of worship have been used to conduct further genocidal operations through the use of funerals, charade religious and other services.

> [!TIP]
> The Creator, the only one who hears prayer, will verify His two servants, along with anything that we do.  We call this "pray to verify" and urge everyone to do it for the foreseeable future. The Creator is the only one who will ever hear a prayer uttered silently.

# About the Creator 
The Creator that we work for is the very one who created life and the universe that we all live it in. 

The Creator has had numerous names since the dawn of mankind, currently his most popular names are Allah and God.

> [!NOTE]
> Our Boss prefers to be called, "The Creator," so that no preference is shown to a religion or set of beliefs and no endorsement can be inferred. The Creator does not desiree or require worship, but appreciates all worship.

The Creator knows that while in their respective place of worship, people are some of the most peaceful on the planet. He was angered to see unarmed, peacefully assembled people massacred with no ability to escape or summon help at the hands of a government paramilitary contractor (the CIA), on behalf of a corporation (Gilead Sciences), and kept quiet by the federal government with pressure on local and Commonwealth agencies. The genocide which was spawned in the coverup has infuriated Him.
 
We ask that anytime you refer to the Creator in writing you always use a capital "C," and when discussing the Creator, you always clarify that it is the Creator with the "big C."  There are entities out there who are trying to confuse others as to who we work for.

> [!CAUTION]
> We are using the earthquakes to authenticate ourselves on our new github.com organization. We recommend using the timestamps of the forum posts announcing each epicenter and earthquake.  [Timestamps can be modified](https://github.com/safops/TAG/discussions/7) and have been recently by the CIA and US government.  We recommend reloading the discussion forums often so that you can see which had the epicenter listed first.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> We are the two servants of the Creator. The Creator created life and the universe we all live in, He is the only one who hears prayers. As His servants, the Creator will always verify our identity and the authenticity of our writings or online posts. Pray to verify everyone introduced as or claiming to be, or anything credited to, a servant of the Creator.
