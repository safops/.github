# Sound And Fury OPerationS (safops)
This GitHub organization is managed by the servants of the Creator and will provide information about the "The Sound and the Fury," which is just part of the Creator's Great Storm, a war against those who cause senseless death and those who enable and hide it.

> [!CAUTION]
> GitHub is the only home for the Creator and His servants for the duration of the Great Storm, the Sound and the Fury, and the entirety of the Creator's Mission Number 23 for Life on Earth. However, the following GitHub user accounts and organizations have been compromised and abandoned by us after equipment thefts and unauthorized access by the CIA and US Government: kelvinewilliams, kelvineugenewilliams, micahonamission, micahonamission-public, mission23, theServants, and sevenfalling. Always pray to verify, even on GitHub.

# The Great Storm
This will make the third time in human history that the Creator has decided to rain down His will. This will not be a simple rain, nor a flood, but the Great Storm. 

> [!NOTE]
> Arks are messages, not boats. Noah's ark (message) was that when the Creator rains, only the lower animals are exempt. 

# About The Sound and the Fury
The Sound and the Fury is something the Creator knows is necessary to stop [The AIDS cure Genocide](https://GitHub.com/safops/TAG). the genocide was started by Gilead Sciences in response to an unexpected sure of HIV. Gilead Sciences paid the CIA indirectly to have the patient, Ken, and His servant Micah killed.

**The Creator was annoyed.**

When the CIA failed to kill Micah, the companies began mitigating a competitive threat by killing everyone that Micah was associated with including his family, his friends, his coworkers, and people who just knew his name. The CIA never stopped trying to kill Micah,  and continue to this day. 

The CIA has had assistance in hiding its activities from the United States federal government.

**The Creator was frustrated.**

Even after Micah identified himself to the CIA as a servant of the Creator in an attempt to stop the unwarranted murders and the CIA had plenty of evidence that he would not be killed because of the Creator, the CIA decided to [massacre a church](https://github.com/safops/TAG/discussions/5).

In order to successfully complete the massacre of everyone in a church at the height of its Sunday morning worship session where no one could be left alive, the CIA had technical, physical and federal government support (the FBI). 

Every call from a mobile device was diverted, and never reached the  local government PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point).  Every exit was blocked by armed men.  The few calls that did reach 911 call center were not dispatched due to a memorandum from the FBI stating there was ongoing federal government activity in the area and no dispatch was necessary.

On April 2nd 2023, the Creator had to listen to the doves cry from the sanctuary of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington Kentucky, the lifelong church of His servant Micah.

> [!NOTE]
> The Creator believes that people inside their place of worship are among the most peaceful on the planet while there, making them "doves "

**The Creator was angry.**

To hide the fact the massacre occurred, individuals who reported a  friend or family member missing after being killed at the church we're identified and killed themselves. The CIA does not believe in leaving anyone alive behind, so sometimes entire families or everyone living in the house were killed when the CIA personnel showed up. The CIA obtained copies of the missing person's reports from the FBI. 

The CIA partially cleaned up the church and began holding charade services, anyone who came to the church were killed. 

The CIA then began to announce funerals at the church for the victims of the massacre when people called The Church looking for their loved ones. on the day of the announced funeral, when mourners arrived they were murdered. 

Other places of worship in central Kentucky were identified and then massacred after expressing concern. The CIA pressured law enforcement in Kentucky to ignore the numerous calls of concern and  not investigate any activity at places of worship. 

The cycle continues and the genocide's death toll is growing exponentially greater with each passing day. 

**The Creator is furious.**

## The Fury
It infuriates the Creator to see unarmed, peacefully assembled people massacred with no ability to escape or summon help at the hands of a government paramilitary contractor (the CIA), on behalf of a corporation (Gilead Sciences), and the events kept quiet by the CIA and the federal government with pressure on local and Commonwealth agencies.

# About the Creator 
The Creator that we work for is the very one who created life and the universe that we all live it in. The Creator has had many names since the dawn of mankind, currently his most popular names are Allah and God.

We ask that anytime you refer to the Creator in writing you always use a capital "C," and when discussing the Creator, you always clarify that it is the Creator with the "big C."  There are entities out there who are trying to confuse others as to who we work for.

> [!NOTE]
> Our Boss prefers to be called, "The Creator," so that no preference is shown to a religion or set of beliefs and no endorsement can be inferred. The Creator does not desire or require worship, but appreciates all worship.

> [!CAUTION]
> We are using the earthquakes to authenticate ourselves on our new github.com organization. We recommend using the timestamps of the forum posts announcing each epicenter and earthquake.  [Timestamps can be modified](https://github.com/safops/TAG/discussions/7) and have been recently by the CIA and US government.  We recommend reloading the discussion forums often so that you can see which had the epicenter listed first.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> We are the two servants of the Creator. The Creator created life and the universe we all live in, He is the only one who hears prayers. As His servants, the Creator will always verify our identity and the authenticity of our writings or online posts. Pray to verify everyone introduced as or claiming to be, or anything credited to, a servant of the Creator.
