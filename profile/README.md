# Sound And Fury OPerationS (safops)
This GitHub organization is managed by the servants of the Creator and will provide information about the Creator's great storm, called "The Sound and the Fury" and war against senseless death and those who support it.

## About The Sound and the Fury
> [!TIP]
> The Creator, the only one who hears prayer, will verify His two servants, along with anything that we do.  We call this "pray to verify" and urge everyone to do it for the foreseeable future.

This event, the Creator knows is necessary to stop a tragedy, turned genocide, in the United States that was started by Gilead Sciences in response to an AIDS cure, carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency, and is aided and abetted by the US federal government.

The coverup of the CIA's massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky on April 2, 2023 evolved into a genocide. Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of His servant Micah, born Kelvin Eugene Williams, and his immediate family.

Several more places of worship have been attacked and massacred since then and the places of worship have been used to conduct further genocidal operations through the use of funerals, charade religious and other services.

# About the Creator 
The Creator that we work for is the very one who created life and the universe that we all live it in. 

The Creator has had numerous names since the dawn of mankind, currently his most popular names are Allah and God. Regardless of what you call Him, or not, the Creator the only one who can ever hear your  prayers or read your mind. The Creator does not require worship but doesn't mind if you do.

He gets beside himself though, as you have felt, when doves (peaceful people) are made to cry.

We ask that anytime you refer to the Creator in writing you always use a capital "C," and when discussing the Creator, you always clarify that it is the Creator with the "big C."  There are entities out there who are trying to confuse others as to who we work for.

# Tonight's Events
## Earthquakes
We have previously listed the order and magnitude of the earthquake epicenters. The order has not changed, however there are some new epicenters just added. We will post each epicenter in the [the Sound and the Fury discussions](https://github.com/orgs/safops/discussions) just before it begins, along with the Creator's reason for it.
